When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository when it is benefitial to work from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might not need all branshes that would automatically update. I would be more in control
